  summary:
    I believe in adding value to the lives of those around me. On a professional level this translates into creating accessible software tailored towards the needs of the user. But above everything it means trying to become the best programmer and person that I can possibly be.


    Passion for all things logical has been the force that pulled me towards computer science ever since I bumped into my first lines of code on my big brother's computer. Small building blocks, with some logic applied, some putting together, and things move around the way you imagine them to. Spend enough time doing that and the fun never ends.


    Fast forward to today with a masters degree and industry experience and the fun of making things work still hasn't ended. Even more, it challenges me every day to push myself harder, find better solutions, and always learn new things. And the best thing I realized about what I do? My job is to help people. They just come to me with problems or ideas and I just go ahead and help them fix them.


    So what can I do to help you today?
